# CRYPTO ARBITRAGE

In this comprehensive module, we will use the Bitstamp and Coinbase Cryto Exchanges to exploit arbitrage opportunities in the price of Bitcoin. This thorough, extensive code wiil execute the following three objectives: 

1. Collect Data

2. Prepare Data

3. Analyze Data

Using the differentiating prices of Bitcoin within the two exchanges, we will exploit this rare trading phenomenon and show how to not only spot it, but profit from it. Before we get started, here is a directory of the foundational aspects of the code, which all play an integral part in its application.


## TECHNOLOGIES

In order for this trading technique to be properly plotted, there are installations required. They are the following:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Python programming language.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Access to the web-based IDE JupyterLab.  

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Grants access to the open-source Pandas data analysis tool, which is powered by Python.

[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) - Enables the user to read compiled crypto data.


## USAGE

In order to execute and plot this code, you must run the following:

```python
crypto_arbitrage.ipynb
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import path
%matplotlib inline
```
Accessing JupyterLab in Bash: `Jupyter Lab`
